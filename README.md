# Adoption Website

# Description
This excerise taught us how to use modular JavaScript. Writing multiple JS files and linking them together. This was one of our first individual experiences with using a task running, specifically Grunt. 

Using modular JS techniques the goal was to create a pet adoption site that allowed users to filter the selection of pets by pet type. i.e. Cats, Dogs and Dinos. All pet information was stored in a JSON file that had to be requested before the pets could be printed to the page.
